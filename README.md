# PREDICTIVE IRRIGATION for water sustainability

## Short description

### What's the problem?
  Of all the water on Earth, just 3% is fresh water. Agriculture is by far the largest water consumer, accounting for 69% of annual water withdrawals globally. â€‹

### How can technology help?
  Technology helps getting accurate agricultural data to the farmers at affordable price, preserve historical data and get the best practices followed around world for efficient irrigation.
  
### The idea
  The idea is to build a Cloud based IoT  solution using accurate predictive modelling that helps farmers to determine the current soil moisture and as well as prediction for next 48 hours needed for any crop. It will help farmers to irrigate in efficient way thereby  reducing the usage of fresh water and help the community with the help following
  
  1. IoT devices to collect real time soil moisture data and maintain required Soil moisture level for the crop.
  2. Weather Forecasts based model for irrigation
  3. IoT based Drip Irrigation pump actuator.
  4. Mobile app with user friendly dashboard with current & predicted soil moisture
